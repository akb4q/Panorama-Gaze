# Panorama-Gaze
Panorama and Gaze source code 2018

Description:

In a total range of 1024x720 pixels on a monitor screen, the audiences can use the movement of their own eyes to peek through partials of the entire picture. This work uses the gaze fixed on a certain part as a point of reference, which reveals the imagination of the parts unseen.
